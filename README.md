# Docker samples
Samples and illustrative uses for Docker containers, mainly aimed to tinkering
activities and exploratory projects.

# Usage
Just download the Dockerfile you are interested in (or just copy its content)
and name it "Dockerfile", then use it with the Docker tools provided by your
computer or infrastructure.

For this repository, instead of applying the generic "Dockerfile" name, a more
guiding name is used to indicate its purpose.
